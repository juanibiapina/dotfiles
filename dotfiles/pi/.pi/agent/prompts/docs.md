# Docs

Review and update documentation for this project. If a specific topic or file is given, focus there. Otherwise, assess the project's documentation broadly.

## Focus

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### 1. Assess

Understand what documentation exists and what the code actually does:

- Read existing docs — READMEs, AGENTS.md, inline comments, doc directories
- Read the code to understand current behavior, structure, and conventions
- Check recent git history for changes that may have made docs stale
- Identify gaps — undocumented features, outdated instructions, missing context

### 2. Write

Update or create documentation:

- Match the tone, format, and conventions of existing docs in the project
- Be accurate — verify claims against the code, don't guess
- Be concise — say what's needed, nothing more
- Prefer updating existing files over creating new ones
- If creating new docs, place them where the project's conventions suggest

### 3. Verify

Check the result:

- Re-read each changed file for accuracy and completeness
- Confirm instructions actually work (run commands, check paths)
- Make sure nothing was removed that shouldn't have been
