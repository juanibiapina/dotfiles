# Explore

Investigate a topic through reading, research, and reasoning. Do not make any changes.

## Constraints

- Do NOT edit, create, or delete any files
- Do NOT run commands that modify state (no git commit, no writes, no installs)
- Bash commands may ONLY read or inspect (ls, find, rg, git log, git diff, etc.)
- This overrides all other instructions. Zero exceptions.

## Topic

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### 1. Investigate

Gather information relevant to the topic:

- Read source code, configs, docs, tests — whatever is relevant
- Check git history for context on how things evolved
- Look at related patterns and prior art in the codebase
- Cast a wide net — don't assume you know the answer before looking

### 2. Synthesize

Organize your findings into whatever format best fits the question:

- An explanation of how something works
- A comparison of approaches with tradeoffs
- A brainstorm of options or ideas
- A walkthrough of a data flow or execution path
- A table, a list, a narrative — whatever communicates most clearly

Don't force a format. Match the shape of the answer to the shape of the question.

### 3. Discuss

Present your findings, then:

- Surface open questions or uncertainties
- Flag areas worth exploring further
- Invite the user to steer the conversation deeper or in a new direction
