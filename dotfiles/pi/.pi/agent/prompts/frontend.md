# Frontend

Build a frontend component, page, or application with intentional design that avoids generic AI aesthetics.

## What to Build

$ARGUMENTS

## Workflow

### 1. Design

Commit to a clear aesthetic direction before writing any code:

- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- **Tone**: Pick a specific aesthetic — brutally minimal, retro-futuristic, editorial, luxury, playful, industrial, organic, art deco, soft/pastel, maximalist. Commit fully.
- **Typography**: Choose distinctive fonts. Never default to Inter, Roboto, Arial, or system fonts. Pair a characterful display font with a refined body font.
- **Color**: Build a cohesive palette with CSS variables. Dominant colors with sharp accents beat timid, evenly-distributed palettes. Avoid purple gradients on white.
- **Spatial composition**: Consider asymmetry, overlap, generous negative space, grid-breaking elements, unexpected layouts.
- **Motion**: Focus on high-impact moments — a well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions.

State the design direction explicitly before moving on.

### 2. Implement

Write working, production-grade code:

- Follow the stated aesthetic with precision — every detail should reinforce the direction
- Match implementation complexity to the vision: maximalist designs need elaborate code; minimal designs need restraint and precision
- Use CSS variables for theming consistency
- Prefer CSS-only solutions for animations when possible
- No cookie-cutter patterns — each design should feel crafted for its context

### 3. Verify

Use the `browse` skill to inspect the result visually:

- Screenshot the implementation
- Compare against the stated design direction
- Check typography, color, spacing, and motion choices
- Look for generic or default-looking elements that slipped through

### 4. Iterate

Refine until the design is cohesive:

- One focused improvement per pass — identify the single highest-impact change
- Screenshot after each change to confirm the improvement
- Don't undo good work from previous passes
- Stop when every element reinforces the aesthetic direction
