# Gmail CLI

Command-line interface for Gmail operations.

## Usage

Run `gmcli --help` for full command reference.

Common operations:
- `gmcli <email> search "<query>"` - Search emails using Gmail query syntax
- `gmcli <email> thread <threadId>` - Read a thread with all messages
- `gmcli <email> send --to <emails> --subject <s> --body <b>` - Send email
- `gmcli <email> labels list` - List all labels
- `gmcli <email> drafts list` - List drafts

## Troubleshooting

If you get an `invalid_grant` error, the OAuth token has expired. Re-authenticate by removing and re-adding the account:

```bash
gmcli accounts remove <email> && gmcli accounts add <email>
```
