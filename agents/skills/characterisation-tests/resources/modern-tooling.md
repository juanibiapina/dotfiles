# Modern Tooling for Characterisation Tests

TypeScript/JavaScript tooling that supports the characterisation testing workflow. See the main `characterisation-tests` skill for the process and heuristics.

## Vitest Snapshot Testing

Snapshots automate the "let the failure tell you the behavior" step. Instead of manually copying expected values, the framework captures them.

### Inline Snapshots (Preferred for Characterisation)

The expected value lives right in the test file. Vitest fills it in on first run.

```typescript
it('characterises formatAddress', () => {
  // First run: leave the argument empty -- Vitest fills it in
  expect(formatAddress(testAddress)).toMatchInlineSnapshot();
});

// After first run, Vitest rewrites the file:
it('characterises formatAddress', () => {
  expect(formatAddress(testAddress)).toMatchInlineSnapshot(`
    "123 Main St
    Suite 4B
    Springfield, IL 62701"
  `);
});
```

Inline snapshots are ideal for characterisation because the actual behavior is visible right next to the call -- no separate snapshot file to track.

### File Snapshots

For large outputs (HTML, JSON payloads), write to a separate file:

```typescript
it('characterises full report output', () => {
  const report = generateReport(testData);
  expect(report).toMatchFileSnapshot('./snapshots/report-baseline.txt');
});
```

### When to Use Each

| Approach | Use when |
|----------|----------|
| `toMatchInlineSnapshot()` | Output is short (< 20 lines), readability matters |
| `toMatchSnapshot()` | Output is medium, co-located `.snap` file is fine |
| `toMatchFileSnapshot()` | Output is large, or you want a human-reviewable baseline file |
| Manual `toBe()` / `toEqual()` | You want to document specific values with intent |

## Combination Testing

Test many input combinations at once to rapidly characterise a function's behavior. Use `it.each` with a generated matrix (the `jest-extended-snapshot` library is prior art for this idea, but it is Jest-only — in Vitest, build the matrix yourself as below):

```typescript
// Option 1: it.each with inline snapshot (pure Vitest, no extra dependency)
const amounts = [100, 1000, 10000, 15000] as const;
const types = ['standard', 'premium', 'business'] as const;
const years = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 10] as const;

const combinations = amounts.flatMap(amount =>
  types.flatMap(type =>
    years.map(y => ({ amount, type, years: y })),
  ),
);

it('characterises all input combinations', () => {
  const results = combinations.map(
    c => `${c.type}/${c.amount}/${c.years} → ${calculateDiscount(c.amount, c.type, c.years)}`,
  );
  expect(results).toMatchInlineSnapshot();
  // Vitest fills in all 72 results on first run
});
```

This provides broad characterisation with minimal test code. The snapshot captures every combination's result, so any behavioral change is detected.

**Trade-off:** Combination tests are excellent for initial characterisation but poor for documentation -- a list of 72 results doesn't explain *why* the behavior differs. Replace with focused tests as you understand the code.

## Handling Non-Determinism

Characterisation tests must be deterministic. Common sources of non-determinism and their fixes:

### Dates and Timestamps

Use a helper that sets up and tears down fake timers within a single test, avoiding shared mutable state from `beforeEach`/`afterEach`:

```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest';

const withFrozenTime = (date: string, fn: () => void) => {
  vi.useFakeTimers();
  vi.setSystemTime(new Date(date));
  try {
    fn();
  } finally {
    vi.useRealTimers();
  }
};

it('characterises timestamp formatting', () => {
  withFrozenTime('2025-01-15T10:00:00Z', () => {
    expect(formatTimestamp()).toBe('Jan 15, 2025 10:00 AM');
  });
});
```

### Random Values / UUIDs

```typescript
// Option 1: introduce a parameter seam (preferred — see finding-seams)
const createOrder = (data: OrderData, generateId: () => string = () => crypto.randomUUID()) => ...
// test: createOrder(data, () => 'test-uuid-001')

// Option 2: mock the source (temporary scaffolding only — implementation-coupled)
// (the mock value must be UUID-shaped — randomUUID's return type is a
// `${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}-${string}` template literal)
vi.spyOn(crypto, 'randomUUID').mockReturnValue('00000000-0000-4000-8000-000000000001');

// Option 3: use property matchers with snapshots
expect(result).toMatchSnapshot({
  id: expect.any(String),
  createdAt: expect.any(Date),
});
```

### External Service Responses

Use the `finding-seams` skill to introduce a seam (preferably a function parameter) before characterising. If you cannot modify the production code yet, `vi.mock()` can be used as temporary scaffolding -- but migrate to parameter injection once you have tests in place.

## Approval Testing Workflow

For complex outputs where automated comparison isn't enough, use an explicit approval step:

1. Run code, capture output as `.received.txt`
2. Compare against `.approved.txt` (the golden master)
3. If no approved file exists, the test fails -- a human must review and approve
4. If files differ, the test fails -- a human reviews the change

The `approvals` npm package (`npm install approvals`) provides this workflow with diff tool support (documented Jest/Mocha integration; usable from Vitest via its plain `approvals.verify` API).

**When to prefer approval tests:** When the output is complex enough that a human should review it before accepting as baseline (e.g., HTML rendering, PDF generation, complex business reports).

## Coverage-Guided Characterisation

Use coverage and mutation-aware test design to know when you've characterised enough:

1. **Run tests with coverage**: `vitest --coverage`
2. **Identify untested branches**: look for red/uncovered lines in the area you're changing
3. **Add characterisation tests** targeting those paths
4. **Repeat** until the change area + one layer out has adequate branch coverage
5. **Plan the later mutation gate**: record the changed production scope and likely mutant risks; run the automated `mutation-testing` harness once the completed phase is otherwise ready for its PR

Coverage tells you which paths are *exercised*. Mutation testing tells you which are *protected*. A test that executes a branch but doesn't assert on its effect is a false sense of security. Use mutator rules before changing the code, then use the automated harness at the end-of-phase PR-readiness gate so it does not slow every inner increment.
