description: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR for production behavior changes, followed by proportionate automated evidence at PR readiness. Use before implementing new features, bug fixes, or any changed observable behavior, and as the governing workflow for mixed implementation work. Do not use for pure behavior-preserving refactoring or mechanism reduction; those start from passing preservation evidence via refactoring or reduce-system-complexity. Not for plan-only requests; use planning first for significant multi-slice work.

# Test-Driven Development

TDD is the fundamental practice for new or changed observable behavior: every such production change must be written in response to a failing behavior test.

Pure behavior-preserving work is different. `refactoring` and `reduce-system-complexity` begin from passing proportionate preservation evidence and stay behaviorally green while internal structure changes. At PR readiness, use `reproducible-locally` to record proportionate behavioral, reachability, configuration, contract, integration, or operational evidence. Do not manufacture a failing test merely to make a REFACTOR slice look RED. If the work changes behavior or fixes a disputed bug, return to RED.

In this skill, a **phase** means one PR-sized, independently mergeable slice: the accumulated scope of one branch and PR. It does not mean a multi-PR feature or the numbered lifecycle phases in `README.md`.

**For how to write good tests**, load the `testing` skill. This skill focuses on the TDD workflow. Load `codebase-design` when the lasting module interface or responsibility needs design.

---

## Fast TDD Feedback Loop (AI Default)

The RED-GREEN-REFACTOR inner loop must optimize for fast, relevant feedback. **Do not run the full test suite after every edit.**

Before RED, inspect package scripts, test configuration, and runner help. Repository-owned commands take precedence over generic examples:

1. **Honor the repository's watcher start point** — if it requires a proven watcher before the first edit, start it once now. Otherwise strict TDD may write RED first and start the watcher immediately afterwards. Repository timing overrides the generic example below.
2. **RED** — run the new or changed test file/name and confirm the expected failure.
3. **Select or reuse the watcher deliberately** — prefer a tested repository-owned watch command. It may run the complete relevant development tier once to populate the runtime graph, then rerun only affected tests. For Vitest without such a command, use `--changed <real-base> --watch` only when the installed version and repository configuration have the required live proof.
4. **GREEN/REFACTOR** — keep one watcher in a dedicated reusable terminal/session. Let the runner or repository graph choose affected tests; do not hand-pick a smaller ongoing GREEN scope.
5. **AI/non-interactive fallback** — when a persistent watcher cannot be owned reliably, run the equivalent affected one-shot after each edit.
6. **Repair the right boundary** — restart or reseed for stale or newly graph-visible relationships. For non-import/dynamic dependencies, configuration, global setup, public contracts, or shared-package uncertainty, add repository-owned triggers or widen to the owning suite/tier; restart alone cannot create an absent graph edge.
7. **PR readiness** — stop every watcher, run the repository-defined non-watch PR gate, and capture proportionate automated evidence with `reproducible-locally`. In a monorepo, that final gate includes every configured project and required integration/E2E suite, not only the development subset.

Read [resources/vitest-watch-feedback.md](resources/vitest-watch-feedback.md) before selecting, adding, or changing a reusable Vitest watcher. It is the canonical detail for seed strategies, native discovery, blind spots, and the required live process proof.

### Vitest Seed Semantics

`vitest --changed <real-base> --watch` is **diff-selected for its initial execution**. Vitest clears the VCS selectors after that selection; it does not continuously recompute VCS impact after every save. Later reruns use retained Vite module graphs. In Vitest 4.1.10's ordinary Node/SSR path, initial changed selection statically analyzes every discovered test specification, so an imported implementation edit can rerun its test even when the clean-start initial execution reported no affected tests. Later reruns are therefore not limited to tests that executed initially.

Do not generalize that Vitest 4.1.10 implementation detail to other versions, Browser Mode, dynamic/non-import dependencies, or arbitrary repository configurations. Prefer a behaviorally proven repository-owned command such as `pnpm test:watch` for standard development, a clean refactoring baseline, or a watcher started before RED. A repository may safely run its complete relevant tier once to populate the graph. For strict TDD, starting a proven diff-selected watcher after RED makes it straightforward to confirm that the expected test actually executed. Do not replace a repository command with a generic raw Vitest example.

Examples (adapt to the repository; the first existing command that satisfies the required behavior wins):

```bash
# Repository-owned graph-complete watch, when defined and proven
pnpm test:watch

# Vitest diff-selected initial execution: use only after repository-level proof
pnpm exec vitest --changed origin/main --watch

# Vitest fallbacks: mechanically derived affected sources or one-shots
pnpm exec vitest related src/example.ts --watch
pnpm exec vitest related --run src/example.ts
pnpm exec vitest --changed origin/main --run

# Exact selector: RED/debug only
pnpm exec vitest run tests/example.test.ts -t "rejects empty names"

# Jest: repository/runner changed watch, or affected one-shot
pnpm exec jest --watch
pnpm exec jest --watch --changedSince=origin/main
pnpm exec jest --findRelatedTests src/example.ts --watch=false
pnpm exec jest --onlyChanged --watch=false
pnpm exec jest --changedSince=origin/main --watch=false
pnpm exec jest --runTestsByPath tests/example.test.ts -t "rejects empty names"

# Playwright: runner-selected affected one-shot (heuristic; inspect the selected tests)
pnpm exec playwright test --only-changed
pnpm exec playwright test --only-changed=origin/main
```

Vitest natively discovers a new matching test file when include globs remain open. Confirm that the new test actually executes and loads its implementation before trusting later implementation reruns. Do not add custom filesystem listeners or call rerun APIs unless live proof shows native discovery is insufficient; doing both can execute a new test twice.

`vitest related <sources...>` is a fallback only when every source path is derived mechanically. It implicitly permits an empty result to pass, so confirm an expected test executed. Do not use `--passWithNoTests` as evidence. Do not use `--standalone`: it either skips the initial run without a file filter or reduces the workflow to a supplied filter.

### Watcher Lifecycle and Automation Safety

- Start one watcher in a dedicated reusable terminal/session and reuse it throughout the inner loop.
- After the final edit, stop it with `Ctrl+C` before PR gates or task handoff. Do not leave background watchers behind.
- When automation spawns a watcher, timeout and signal cleanup must terminate the entire watcher process group—not only its immediate parent—and remove temporary directories.
- Never invoke a watch command from CI, Git hooks, finite lint/test/build/verification scripts, or another package script intended to terminate. Detect common forms including bare `vitest` in an interactive TTY, `vitest watch`, `vitest --watch`, `vitest --watch=true`, `vitest -w`, and `vitest -w=true`. Finite Vitest commands must force termination with `vitest run`, `--run`, or `--watch=false`.
- Treat a command that mixes a watch subcommand or positive watch flag with a finite marker as watch mode: `vitest run --watch` and `vitest watch --watch=false` are not finite.
- The sole exception is an isolated live-proof harness whose subject is the watcher itself. It must use an ephemeral fixture, enforce a hard timeout, terminate the entire watcher process group on success or failure, remove the fixture, and never expose the watch invocation as an ordinary finite package/CI command.
- Observe output emitted after the relevant rerun. A stale waiting marker, zero tests, or a process made green by a pass-with-no-tests option is not evidence.

Explicit watch remains long-lived even without a TTY; it does not become a finite command in CI. Bare `vitest` can default to watch when stdin is a TTY and neither CI nor Vitest's agent detection disables it. Never rely on environment auto-detection to make a finite command terminate. For other runners, prefer a tested repository-owned watcher, then native changed/affected selection, dependency-aware selection from a complete mechanically derived source list, the graph-derived affected package/project set, and finally an affected one-shot. Exact selectors remain RED/debug-only.

### Monorepos

Run changed/affected selection from the repository root through the project-defined test command, root Vitest `projects` configuration, or monorepo orchestrator that owns the complete workspace dependency graph. A shared-package edit may affect tests in several consumers, so do not `cd` into one package or add `--project` based only on the file being edited. A project filter is safe only when Vitest or the repository's package/task graph mechanically derived the complete affected project set, including transitive dependents.

Confirm the root configuration enumerates every relevant project and that cross-package imports are graph-visible. Filesystem reads, subprocess targets, generated output, templates, proxy-fetched dependencies, type-only relationships, file-scanning repository guards, browser-mode tests, and Docker-backed tiers may need repository-specific triggers or separate commands. Preserve `watchTriggerPatterns` and `forceRerunTriggers` where configured. Restart/reseed only repairs stale or newly graph-visible relationships; configure an explicit mapping or run the owning suite/tier for dependencies the graph cannot represent.

Watch mode is an inner-loop accelerator, not PR evidence. The pre-PR record must come from a completed non-watch full run against the final tree.

### Repository Authority

Repository-specific test and evidence rules override this global guidance when stricter. Keep the complete non-watch verification and automated proof current after later production or applicable test changes.

## RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Development Cycle

### RED: Write Failing Test First
- For new or changed behavior, NO production code until you have a failing behavior test
- Test describes desired behavior, not implementation
- Test should fail for the right reason
- Run the narrowest test selector that demonstrates this RED; do not spend the inner loop running unrelated tests
- Before finalizing the test, scan the intended behavior for boundaries, boolean combinations, equality, arithmetic identities, array/string operations, optional chaining, and side effects
- Add obvious missing cases immediately; use the harness's ask-question facility when the expected behavior is a product/domain judgment

### GREEN: Minimum Code to Pass
- Write ONLY enough code to make the test pass
- Resist adding functionality not demanded by a test
- Faking it is legitimate: hardcode the return value if that passes, then triangulate — add a second test case that forces the real implementation. Generalize only when a test demands it
- Use the active focused watcher or related/affected one-shot command; widen only after the focused behavior is green

### REFACTOR: Assess Improvements
- Assess after GREEN using the passing behavior tests as the working safety net
- Load the `refactoring` skill only when restructuring is applicable; record `N/A` otherwise
- Obtain approval for the working-baseline commit before refactoring when the workflow uses commits as safety checkpoints
- Keep focused and affected tests green after each small refactor; run the full suite at the pre-PR gate

Repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR as needed until the phase's PR scope is complete.

## End-of-Phase PR-Readiness Gate

Run this gate once implementation and refactoring are complete and the work is otherwise ready for a PR:

1. **STOP WATCHERS**: terminate every watcher and its child processes.
2. **VERIFY**: run the repository-defined complete non-watch checks against the final tree.
3. **PROVE**: use `reproducible-locally` to exercise the changed behavior and assert an observable postcondition, or report why automated proof is unavailable.
4. **REPORT**: state the commands, scenarios, assertions, and results without inflating what they prove.

---

## TDD Evidence in Commit History

### Default Expectation

Commit history should show clear RED → GREEN → REFACTOR when applicable. Final automated proof is PR-readiness evidence for the completed phase, not a required commit after every TDD increment.

**Ideal progression:**
```
commit abc123: test: add failing test for user authentication
commit def456: feat: implement user authentication to pass test
commit ghi789: refactor: extract validation logic for clarity

Pre-PR gate: stop watchers, run the complete repository checks, and capture
repeatable automated proof of the changed behavior before creating the PR.
```

### Rare Exceptions

TDD evidence may not be linearly visible in commits in these cases:

**1. Multi-Session Work**
- Feature spans multiple development sessions
- Work done with TDD in each session
- Commits organized for PR clarity rather than strict TDD phases
- **Evidence**: Tests exist, all passing, implementation matches test requirements

**2. Context Continuation**
- Resuming from previous work
- Original RED phase done in previous session/commit
- Current work continues from that point
- **Evidence**: Reference to RED commit in PR description

**3. Refactoring Commits**
- Large refactors after GREEN with a passing behavior-test baseline
- Multiple small refactors combined into single commit
- All tests remained green throughout
- **Evidence**: Commit message notes "refactor only, no behavior change"

### Documenting Exceptions in PRs

When exception applies, document in PR description:

```markdown
## TDD Evidence

RED phase: commit c925187 (added failing tests for shopping cart)
GREEN phase: commits 5e0055b, 9a246d0 (implementation + bug fixes)
REFACTOR: commit 11dbd1a (test isolation improvements)
PRE-PR PROOF: checkout scenario verified by `pnpm test:e2e`; 4/4 assertions passed

Test Evidence:
✅ 4/4 tests passing (7.7s with 4 workers)
```

**Important**: These exceptions concern evidence presentation. New or changed behavior still follows RED. A true behavior-preserving refactor follows the explicit REFACTOR path above and should document its passing pre-change oracles rather than inventing a RED phase.

## Coverage Verification - CRITICAL

### NEVER Trust Coverage Claims Without Verification

**Always run coverage yourself before approving PRs.**

### Verification Process

**Before approving any PR claiming "100% coverage":**

1. Check out the branch
   ```bash
   git checkout feature-branch
   ```

2. Run coverage verification (adapt to the project's package manager and layout):
   ```bash
   pnpm test:coverage
   # OR
   pnpm exec vitest run --coverage
   ```

3. Verify ALL metrics hit 100%:
   - Lines: 100% ✅
   - Statements: 100% ✅
   - Branches: 100% ✅
   - Functions: 100% ✅

4. Check that tests are behavior-driven (not testing implementation details)

**For anti-patterns that create fake coverage (coverage theater)**, see the `testing` skill.

### Reading Coverage Output

Look for the "All files" line in coverage summary:

```
File           | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s
---------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------
All files      |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
setup.ts       |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
context.ts     |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
endpoints.ts   |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |
```

✅ This is 100% coverage - all four metrics at 100%.

### Red Flags

Watch for these signs of incomplete coverage:

❌ **PR claims "100% coverage" but you haven't verified**
- Never trust claims without running coverage yourself

❌ **Coverage summary shows <100% on any metric**
```
All files      |   97.11 |    93.97 |   81.81 |   97.11 |
```
- This is NOT 100% coverage (Functions: 81.81%, Lines: 97.11%)

❌ **"Uncovered Line #s" column shows line numbers**
```
setup.ts       |   95.23 |      100 |      60 |   95.23 | 45-48, 52-55
```
- Lines 45-48 and 52-55 are not covered

❌ **Coverage gaps without explicit exception documentation**
- If coverage <100%, exception should be documented (see Exception Process below)

### When Coverage Drops, Ask

**"What business behavior am I not testing?"**

NOT "What line am I missing?"

Add tests for behavior, and coverage follows naturally.

---

## 100% Coverage Exception Process

### Default Rule: 100% Coverage Required

No exceptions without explicit approval and documentation.

This applies to code developed with TDD. When working in legacy code, the scope is the change area, not the whole codebase — see the `characterisation-tests` skill for that workflow.

### Requesting an Exception

If 100% coverage cannot be achieved:

**Step 1: Document in package README**

Explain:
- Current coverage metrics
- WHY 100% cannot be achieved in this package
- WHERE the missing coverage will come from (integration tests, E2E, etc.)

**Step 2: Get explicit approval**

From project maintainer or team lead

**Step 3: Document in project guidance**

Record the exception in the package README or the nearest applicable `AGENTS.md`, following the project's convention.

**Example Exception:**

```markdown
## Current Exceptions

- **Next.js Adapter**: 86% function coverage
  - Documented in `/packages/nextjs-adapter/README.md`
  - Missing coverage from SSR functions (tested in E2E layer)
  - Approved: 2024-11-15
```

### Remember

The burden of proof is on the requester. 100% is the default expectation.

## Development Workflow

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Honor the repository start point** - start its proven watcher before the first edit when required; otherwise start it immediately after RED
2. **Write failing test** - describe expected behavior
3. **Start or observe focused feedback** - prefer the repository-owned watcher; otherwise use a diff-selected Vitest watcher only after its installed version/configuration has passed the canonical live proof, or use the affected one-shot equivalent; confirm the expected test fails for the expected reason
4. **Implement minimum** - just enough to pass
5. **Run focused/affected tests** - confirm the behavior and its related tests pass
6. **Refactor if applicable and valuable** - improve code structure while focused and affected tests stay green
7. **STOP and wait for commit approval** - present the increment and ordinary verification; never commit without explicit user approval
8. **Commit** - with conventional commit message, once approved
9. **Repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR** - continue with further increments and approved commits until the planned PR scope is complete
10. **At PR readiness, prove the final tree** - stop watchers, complete the repository-defined non-watch PR checks, and use `reproducible-locally` for proportionate automated proof

### Workflow Example

```bash
# 1. If the repository requires its watcher before the first edit, start it now:
# pnpm test:watch

# 2. Write failing test
it('should reject empty user names', () => {
  const result = createUser({ id: 'user-123', name: '' });
  expect(result.success).toBe(false);
}); # ❌ Test fails (no implementation)

# 3. If it is not already running, start the tested repository watcher now.
#    Starting after RED makes the expected initial execution easy to verify when
#    the repository does not mandate an earlier start.
pnpm test:watch
# If no repository watcher exists and this Vitest version/configuration has
# passed the live proof:
pnpm exec vitest --changed origin/main --watch
# Or use an affected one-shot:
pnpm exec vitest --changed origin/main --run

# 4. Confirm the expected RED test executed, then implement minimum code
if (user.name === '') {
  return { success: false, error: 'Name required' };
} # ✅ Test passes

# 5. Refactor if needed (extract validation, improve naming)

# 6. STOP — present the increment + ordinary verification, wait for commit approval

# 7. Commit (after approval)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: reject empty user names"

# 8. Repeat RED-GREEN-REFACTOR increments.

# 9. After the final edit, stop the watcher with Ctrl+C.

# 10. Finish the repository-defined complete non-watch checks and use
#     reproducible-locally to capture automated proof for the final tree.
```

## Pull Request Requirements

Before submitting PR:

- [ ] All tests must pass
- [ ] All linting and type checks must pass
- [ ] **Coverage verification REQUIRED** - claims must be verified before review/approval
- [ ] **Automated proof recorded** - the changed behavior has repeatable evidence, or the report states why that proof is unavailable
- [ ] Evidence is current for the final tree and satisfies the target repository's stricter rules
- [ ] Watchers are stopped and the repository-defined complete non-watch PR test gate passes; in monorepos it includes all configured projects and required integration/E2E suites
- [ ] PRs focused on single feature or fix
- [ ] Include behavior description (not implementation details)

**Example PR Description:**

```markdown
## Summary

Adds support for user role-based permissions with configurable access levels.

## Behavior Changes

- Users can now have multiple roles with fine-grained permissions
- Permission check via `hasPermission(user, resource, action)`
- Default role assigned if not specified

## Test Evidence

✅ 42/42 tests passing
✅ 100% coverage verified (see coverage report)

## TDD Evidence

RED: commit 4a3b2c1 (failing tests for permission system)
GREEN: commit 5d4e3f2 (implementation)
REFACTOR: commit 6e5f4a3 (extract permission resolution logic)
```

## Refactoring Priority

After GREEN establishes a passing behavior-test baseline, assess and classify improvement opportunities when restructuring is applicable. For the priority classification table and detailed methodology, load the `refactoring` skill — it owns that guidance. Mutation testing verifies the accumulated result later at the end-of-phase PR-readiness gate.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Writing new or changed production behavior without a failing behavior test
- ❌ Fabricating failing tests for implementation shape to justify a behavior-preserving refactor
- ❌ Testing implementation details (spies on internal methods)
- ❌ 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files
- ❌ Using `let`/`beforeEach` for test data
- ❌ Trusting coverage claims without verification
- ❌ Mocking the function being tested
- ❌ Redefining schemas in test files
- ❌ Factories returning partial/incomplete objects
- ❌ Speculative code ("just in case" logic without tests)
- ❌ Re-running the full suite after every edit instead of using focused watch or related/affected test selection
- ❌ Hand-picking one test file for GREEN/REFACTOR when the runner can derive all affected tests from the complete change set
- ❌ Freezing an exact test-file list at watcher startup so newly created tests cannot join the loop
- ❌ Treating zero collected tests or `--passWithNoTests` as passing RED/GREEN evidence
- ❌ Treating a watch-mode result as the completed pre-PR full-suite gate
- ❌ Assuming `--changed --watch` recomputes VCS impact after every save, or that later reruns are limited to tests executed by the initial VCS-selected run
- ❌ Leaving a watcher or its child processes running after the loop, timeout, or handoff
- ❌ Invoking watch mode from CI, hooks, or another finite command except inside its bounded, cleanup-proven live-proof harness

**For detailed testing anti-patterns**, load the `testing` skill.
