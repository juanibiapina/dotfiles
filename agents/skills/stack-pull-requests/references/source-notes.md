# Stack Pull Requests Source Notes

Load this resource for source provenance, teaching, or updating preview-specific guidance. Do not load it for ordinary stack decisions.

## Primary Source Map

| Source | Guidance used |
|---|---|
| [Stack AI-generated code in pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/stack-ai-generated-code-in-pull-requests) | Design the stack before code generation; use small coherent dependency-ordered layers; build and self-review bottom first; keep fixes in the owning layer; rebase upward; review and merge bottom-up |
| [Review AI-generated code](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/tutorials/review-ai-generated-code) | Run automated checks; verify context and intent; assess maintainability and dependencies; look for hallucinated APIs, ignored constraints, deleted tests, and plausible-looking wrong logic; combine human and automated review |
| [Managing stacked pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/create-pull-requests/managing-stacked-pull-requests) | Make lower-boundary changes on their owning branch; cascade rebases; preserve a linear history; restructure stacks deliberately; sync after merges |
| [Reviewing stacked pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/how-tos/review-pull-requests/reviewing-stacked-pull-requests) | Review each layer's focused diff; update the owning branch; rebase and retest upstack |
| [Stacked pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/reference/stacked-pull-requests) | Native stack rules, checks, reviews, CODEOWNERS, code scanning, and Actions evaluate against the stack trunk; selected lower prefixes merge atomically; merge queues preserve dependency order |
| [Stacked pull requests CLI commands](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/reference/stacked-prs-cli-commands) | Current `gh stack` command model, native linking, safe-lease but non-atomic pushes, all-or-nothing prefix merges, stack modification prerequisites, draft submission behavior, and cumulative rebase/sync semantics |
| [Events that trigger workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows) | Ordinary unlinked PR branch filters use the immediate base; merge queues need `merge_group` triggers for required checks |
| [Graphite: How to structure a stack](https://graphite.com/docs/how-to-structure-your-stacks) | Useful candidate boundaries: functional components, iterative improvements, refactor-then-change, risk isolation, and dependency-aware ordering |
| [Graphite: Best practices for reviewing stacks](https://graphite.com/docs/best-practices-for-reviewing-stacks) | Make each PR atomic enough to understand, submit ready layers early, mark work-in-progress layers draft, choose focused reviewers, and review bottom-up |
| [Graphite: CI optimizations](https://graphite.com/docs/stacking-and-ci) | Stacks multiply CI and rebase runs; use existing caching or affected-test mechanisms when scale justifies it, without weakening required merge checks |
| [Sapling: Stacks of commits](https://sapling-scm.com/docs/overview/stacks/) | `absorb` and targeted amend demonstrate assigning a newly discovered correction to its lower owning change and rewriting descendants |

## Reconciliation With This Skill Set

GitHub's tutorial uses an authentication example ordered as data model, CRUD endpoints, JWT middleware, then integration and unit tests. That illustrates dependency-ordered review layers, but copying it literally would conflict with this repository's `story-splitting`, `planning`, `tdd`, and `testing` contracts.

This skill therefore makes these synthesis decisions:

- Keep backlog stories vertical and valuable. Treat PR boundaries as delivery boundaries, not child stories.
- Default to one vertical PR. Stacking is optional and must earn its coordination cost.
- Prefer whole vertical slices as stack members when they have hard dependency or deliberate flow lineage; otherwise prefer testable path increments within a fixed slice and do not add acceptance scope by calling a new behavior an intra-slice PR layer.
- Permit a horizontal lower layer only when it is coherent, directly required, independently verified, and safe or dormant.
- Keep tests with the earliest behavior they protect. Never create a final "all tests" layer.
- Use the repository's fast RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop inside a layer and its mutation-or-alternate-evidence gate once when that layer is PR-ready.
- Require the top branch to prove the cumulative criteria for every included slice without expanding the approved story scope.
- Distinguish independently reviewable from independently mergeable or releasable.
- Treat a backlog story, vertical implementation slice, and dependent PR boundary as different units; choose the exact stack scope rather than stacking a whole plan by default.
- Treat a stack as branch topology, not a semantic work category. A stack may contain one slice's review layers or several complete vertical slices with hard dependency or deliberate flow lineage while work overlaps review.
- Prefer independent trunk-based PRs when slices can merge in any order. Correcting a lower stacked branch and cascading the fix upward is a real workflow benefit, but it also rebases every affected branch and re-triggers CI, so it is a supporting factor rather than sufficient justification by itself.
- Distinguish GitHub-native linked stacks, whose CI and rules evaluate against the stack trunk, from unlinked dependent PRs, which retain ordinary immediate-base workflow semantics.

## Preview Caveat

GitHub labels stacked pull requests and `gh stack` as public preview. Treat the current stack reference, management pages, CLI reference, and live help as operational authority; re-check Actions, merge, and queue behavior instead of assuming ordinary dependent-PR semantics.

Do not hardcode a minimum GitHub CLI version in the main skill. The tutorial and command reference currently state different minimum versions. Verify the installed extension and current official prerequisites when execution matters.

## Native Creation And Proof

- Use `gh stack submit` for a locally tracked stack.
- Use `gh stack link <bottom> ... <top>` to create or update the remote stack when branches or pull requests already exist. Arguments are ordered from bottom to top; the command creates the native stack and corrects the PR base chain.
- Verify GitHub's remote object before calling the result a native stack. Query `PullRequest.stack` and confirm it is non-null with the intended trunk and bottom-to-top entries. PR base refs alone prove only a dependent branch chain.
- Treat GitHub's **Create stack** prompt as evidence that the pull requests are not linked yet.
- If a command wrapper does not expose `gh stack`, use its raw pass-through mode rather than silently falling back to ordinary PR creation. In RTK environments, use `rtk proxy gh stack ...`.

## Updating The Skill

When GitHub changes the preview:

1. Re-read the official tutorial, management, review, merge, and CLI reference pages.
2. Check live `gh stack --help`.
3. Update operational wording, not the durable story/PR distinction.
4. Preserve the local verification cadence and vertical-slice contracts even if external examples defer tests or split strictly by components.
