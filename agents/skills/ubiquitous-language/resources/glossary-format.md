# Glossary Format and Bootstrap

## Format: Contextive YAML, one glossary per bounded context

`<context>.glossary.yml`, living in the repo (typically beside the context's code or in a `glossaries/` folder — Contextive's folder-based scoping maps contexts in a monorepo). Contextive is the established format with editor support: LSP-based hover definitions and autocomplete for glossary terms across file types in VS Code, IntelliJ, and Neovim — the vocabulary teaches itself ambiently while people type.

```yaml
# ordering.glossary.yml
contexts:
  - name: Ordering
    domainVisionStatement: >
      Customers assemble orders and pay; the context owns the order
      lifecycle from basket to confirmed receipt.
    paths:
      - src/ordering
    terms:
      - name: Order
        definition: A customer's request to purchase, from basket to fulfilment.
        examples:
          - A customer paying by card receives a confirmed order and a receipt.
      - name: Receipt
        definition: The confirmed proof of payment for an order.
      - name: abandonCheckout
        definition: >
          Customer leaves the checkout flow before payment, releasing any
          held inventory.
        examples:
          - Held seats are released when the customer abandons checkout.
```

Deprecation example — the replaced word becomes an alias **on the canonical term** (Contextive's alias semantics), and the lint convention layers deprecation on top:

```yaml
      - name: Order
        definition: A customer's request to purchase, from basket to fulfilment.
        aliases:
          - Booking # DEPRECATED 2026-07-04 — lint rejects it naming Order; see ADR
```

Note: Contextive treats aliases as neutral alternatives (hover on `Booking` shows Order's definition — helpful during migration). Treating an alias as *deprecated* — rejected by the lint with the replacement named — is this framework's convention layered on the same field.

Conventions:

- **Aliases carry deprecations**: when a term is replaced, the old word becomes an `aliases` entry on the new term — this is what lets the lints reject the old word *and name its replacement* in the error message.
- **Examples matter**: one domain sentence per term where possible — they feed test titles and hover docs.
- **The glossary is the index, not the truth**: the code and the team's speech are the current language; the glossary is reconciled against them by lint on every build, which is what keeps it alive rather than rotting.

## Bootstrap paths

**Greenfield** — bootstrap the glossary from specification examples and domain conversations. Their nouns and verbs become candidate terms, and each enters through the protocol when first used. Keep the glossary small, accurate, and growing rather than defining all vocabulary up front.

**From a working conversation** — mine a design session, grill-me transcript, or story-splitting output for candidate terms: recurring nouns and verbs, anything two people used differently, anything that needed explaining. Each candidate goes through PROPOSE individually — extraction gathers candidates; only the protocol admits them.

**Brownfield** — harvest candidates from the code that already speaks the language: exported domain identifiers, event names, database entities. Expect collisions and near-duplicates — surfacing them is the value (each collision is a DETECT trigger). Admit terms as slices touch them, matching the protected-core ratchet: the glossary grows with the strangled core, not ahead of it.

## What does NOT belong in a glossary

- Technical vocabulary (`map`, `parse`, `index`, `id`) — that's the lint layer's stopword list, not the domain language.
- Framework and library names.
- Terms from *other* bounded contexts — if Ordering keeps talking about Shipping's concepts, resolve the context relationship rather than adding them to this glossary.
