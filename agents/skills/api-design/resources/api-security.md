# API Security

Deep-dive on security at the API boundary. See the main `api-design` skill for validation patterns and error security (RFC 9457 §5). See the `typescript-strict` skill for schema-first validation at trust boundaries.

## OWASP API Security Top 10 (2023)

The authoritative security checklist for APIs. Ordered by prevalence and impact.

### 1. Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)

The most common and dangerous API vulnerability. The API doesn't verify that the authenticated user has access to the specific object they're requesting.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — only checks authentication, not authorization
app.get('/api/orders/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const order = await orderService.getById(req.params.id);
  return res.json(order); // Any authenticated user can see ANY order
});

// ✅ CORRECT — verifies the user owns this resource
app.get('/api/orders/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => {
  const order = await orderService.getById(req.params.id);
  if (order.userId !== req.user.id) {
    return res.status(404).json({
      type: 'about:blank',
      title: 'Not Found',
      status: 404,
      detail: 'Order not found',
    });
  }
  return res.json(order);
});
```

Return 404 (not 403) when a user doesn't have access — confirming an object exists is itself an information leak.

### 2. Broken Authentication

Weak authentication mechanisms, missing rate limiting on auth endpoints, credential stuffing.

Mitigations:
- Rate limit authentication endpoints aggressively
- Use strong password policies or passwordless auth
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Never expose whether an email/username exists in error responses ("Invalid credentials" not "User not found")

### 3. Broken Object Property Level Authorization

Mass assignment — accepting fields the user shouldn't be able to set. Excessive data exposure — returning fields the user shouldn't see.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — accepts any field from the request body
const user = await userService.update(req.params.id, req.body);

// ✅ CORRECT — explicitly pick allowed fields
const allowedUpdates = UpdateUserSchema.parse(req.body);
const user = await userService.update(req.params.id, allowedUpdates);
```

Schema validation at the boundary (see `typescript-strict` skill) prevents mass assignment by design — only fields defined in the schema are accepted.

### 4. Unrestricted Resource Consumption

Missing rate limits, no pagination limits, unbounded queries, expensive operations without throttling.

Mitigations:
- Rate limit all endpoints (see main skill: Rate Limiting section)
- Set maximum page sizes on pagination
- Limit query complexity (especially for GraphQL)
- Set request body size limits
- Use timeouts on all downstream calls

### 5. Broken Function Level Authorization

Admin endpoints accessible to regular users. Different authorization requirements for different operations on the same resource.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — same middleware for all operations
app.use('/api/users', requireAuth);

// ✅ CORRECT — different authorization per operation
app.get('/api/users/:id', requireAuth, async (req, res) => { ... });
app.delete('/api/users/:id', requireAuth, requireAdmin, async (req, res) => { ... });
```

### 6. Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

Automated abuse of legitimate flows: ticket scalping, coupon abuse, spam account creation.

Mitigations:
- Rate limit business-critical endpoints more aggressively
- CAPTCHA for account creation and other abusable flows
- Device fingerprinting for high-value operations
- Anomaly detection on usage patterns

### 7. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

URLs in request parameters that the server fetches — allowing attackers to reach internal services.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — blindly fetches user-provided URL
app.post('/api/webhooks', async (req, res) => {
  const response = await fetch(req.body.callbackUrl); // SSRF risk
});

// ✅ CORRECT — validate and restrict
app.post('/api/webhooks', async (req, res) => {
  const url = new URL(req.body.callbackUrl);
  if (url.hostname === 'localhost' || url.hostname.startsWith('10.')) {
    return res.status(422).json({ ... }); // Block internal addresses
  }
  // Additional: allowlist domains, block private IP ranges
});
```

### 8. Security Misconfiguration

Missing security headers, verbose error messages in production, unnecessary HTTP methods enabled, CORS misconfiguration.

Checklist:
- Set `Content-Type: application/problem+json` on error responses (not `text/html`)
- Disable stack traces in production error responses
- Remove `X-Powered-By` and other server identification headers
- Configure CORS restrictively — don't use `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` for authenticated APIs
- Disable HTTP methods you don't use (e.g. TRACE — but keep OPTIONS if you serve cross-origin browser clients; CORS preflight requires it)

### 9. Improper Inventory Management

Forgotten old API versions still running, undocumented endpoints, debug endpoints left in production.

Mitigations:
- Maintain an API inventory (OpenAPI spec as source of truth)
- Decommission old versions on schedule (see `api-evolution.md`)
- Review deployed endpoints regularly — remove anything not in the spec
- Never deploy debug/test endpoints to production

### 10. Unsafe Consumption of APIs

Blindly trusting data from third-party APIs. This is #10 in OWASP but critical — an upstream compromise becomes your compromise.

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG — trusts third-party response
const userData = await thirdPartyApi.getUser(id);
await db.insert('users', userData); // Unsanitized data into your database

// ✅ CORRECT — validate at the boundary
const rawData = await thirdPartyApi.getUser(id);
const userData = ExternalUserSchema.parse(rawData); // Validate shape and content
await db.insert('users', userData);
```

This aligns with the main skill's principle: third-party API responses are untrusted data.

## Authentication Patterns

### API Keys

Simple, good for server-to-server communication.

- **Always send in headers** (`Authorization: Bearer sk_live_...`), never in URL query params — URLs end up in logs, browser history, and referer headers
- Scope keys by permission level (read-only vs read-write)
- Support key rotation without downtime (accept old and new keys during transition)
- Prefix keys by environment (`sk_live_`, `sk_test_`) to prevent accidental cross-environment use

### OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

OAuth delegates access; OpenID Connect adds authentication. Select a grant and identity profile from the actual goal, client type, user-agent context, issuer/resource topology, and provider capabilities—authorization code is not the answer to machine, device, or token-exchange use cases.

For redirect-based authorization-code flows, RFC 9700 requires PKCE for public clients and recommends it for confidential clients; use `S256`. It also requires exact redirect matching, forbids the resource-owner-password grant, and forbids clients from placing access tokens in URI query parameters. Responses that issue access tokens at the authorization endpoint SHOULD NOT be used unless every named injection and leakage vector is mitigated.

Load the `secure-oauth-oidc` skill before designing or reviewing an OAuth/OIDC flow. It provides the full RFC 9700 / BCP 240 and OIDC workflow, including applicability-aware controls, issuer and transaction binding, attack analysis, and negative tests. Use `auth-security.md` for JWT BCP guidance.

### JWT Considerations

JWTs are useful for stateless authentication but have important tradeoffs:

- **JWTs cannot be revoked** without additional infrastructure (blocklist/denylist)
- **Keep them short-lived** (5-15 minutes for access tokens)
- **Never store sensitive data in the payload** — it's base64-encoded, not encrypted
- **Hardcode your allowed algorithms** — never let the token's `alg` header alone dictate the algorithm (prevents `alg: none` and RSA/HMAC confusion attacks)
- **Validate `iss`, `sub`, `aud`, `exp`** on every JWT
- **Use explicit `typ` headers** to prevent cross-JWT confusion (e.g., `at+jwt` for access tokens)
- **Use asymmetric signing** (RS256/ES256) for distributed systems — verifiers don't need the signing key

See `auth-security.md` for the full deep-dive on JWT security (RFC 8725 / BCP 225), including algorithm allowlisting, key-algorithm binding, input sanitization, and compression oracle attacks.

### Decision Framework

| Scenario | Pattern |
|----------|---------|
| Server-to-server, trusted environment | API keys |
| User-facing app, delegated access | OAuth 2.0 + PKCE |
| Microservices, stateless auth needed | JWT (short-lived) + refresh tokens |
| Internal tools, SSO integration | OAuth 2.0 with your identity provider |

## Browser Security Headers

Even non-browser APIs are accessible from browsers. A malicious page can issue requests to any API the user's browser can reach (RFC 9205 / BCP 56). Send these headers on all API responses:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
```

Additional:
- Use application-specific media types in `Content-Type` (e.g., `application/vnd.myapp+json`)
- Set `HttpOnly` flag on cookies
- Avoid compressing sensitive data (tokens, passwords) alongside attacker-controlled content -- compression oracles (CRIME/BREACH) allow secret recovery

See `http-fundamentals.md` for full HTTP protocol security guidance.

## Transport Security

Use TLS for all API communication. Per RFC 9325 (BCP 195):
- TLS 1.2 is the minimum acceptable version
- TLS 1.3 is preferred
- TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are deprecated (RFC 8996 / BCP 195)

## Security Checklist

When reviewing an API for security:

- [ ] Object-level authorization on every endpoint (not just authentication)
- [ ] Schema validation at every input boundary
- [ ] Rate limiting on all endpoints, aggressive on auth endpoints
- [ ] No internal details in error responses (stack traces, file paths, SQL)
- [ ] CORS configured restrictively
- [ ] API keys in headers only, never in URLs
- [ ] Third-party API responses validated before use
- [ ] All endpoints documented in API spec — no shadow endpoints
- [ ] Short-lived tokens with proper validation (algorithm, iss, sub, aud, exp)
- [ ] SSRF protections on any endpoint accepting URLs
- [ ] Browser security headers on all responses (X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy)
- [ ] TLS 1.2+ enforced, TLS 1.0/1.1 disabled
- [ ] OAuth flows use PKCE with S256
