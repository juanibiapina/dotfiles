# CLI Design: Unix-Composable Command-Line Interfaces

This skill covers **language-agnostic** CLI design principles. The rules about stream separation, exit codes, format flags, and composability apply regardless of implementation language.

For API contract stability and Hyrum's Law, see the `api-design` skill. For config, env vars, and graceful shutdown, see the `twelve-factor` skill.

**TypeScript implementation patterns** are in the `resources/` directory. Load them on demand when building a CLI in TypeScript:

| Resource | Load when... |
|----------|-------------|
| `output-architecture.md` | Implementing Result types, entry point wiring, formatters, logger, JSON envelope schemas |
| `testing-cli.md` | Writing Vitest tests for CLI behavior (streams, exit codes, pipes, contract tests) |
| `stream-contracts.md` | Understanding Node.js buffering, NDJSON, signal handling, crash-only design |
| `composability.md` | Designing or testing pipe behavior — worked shell examples (jq filtering, NDJSON streaming, stdin, chaining, `--fields`, parallel `xargs`) |

---

## When to Use

- Building any command-line tool (any language)
- Designing command tree, flags, and I/O contracts
- Implementing the output layer (format detection, stream routing)
- Testing CLI behavior (stdout/stderr separation, exit codes)
- Reviewing a CLI for Unix composability

---

## Core Principle

**stdout is for DATA only — the product the user asked for.**
**stderr is for EVERYTHING ELSE — diagnostics, progress, spinners, warnings, errors.**

This separation is what makes `mycli --json | jq ...` work. One spinner character on stdout breaks every downstream pipe.

> "Whatever software you're building, you can be absolutely certain that people will use it in ways you didn't anticipate. Your software will become a part in a larger system — your only choice is over whether it will be a well-behaved part." — clig.dev

---

## The Unix Stream Contract

| Content | Stream | Why |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Primary output (data, results, JSON) | stdout | Pipeable, buffered for throughput |
| Progress bars, spinners, status | stderr | Not data — must not corrupt pipes |
| Warnings, errors, diagnostics | stderr | Visible to user even when stdout is piped |
| Debug/verbose output | stderr | Diagnostic, never data |

**Buffering behavior:**

- **stdout**: line-buffered when connected to a TTY, block-buffered when piped (~2x faster than stderr)
- **stderr**: unbuffered — every write is a syscall (immediate but expensive)
- **Check each stream independently** — stdout being piped does not mean stderr is piped

When stdout is piped, the user doesn't want your status messages in their data. All non-data output must go to stderr.

For a deep dive on buffering behavior and performance implications, see `resources/stream-contracts.md`.

---

## Keep Handlers Pure

The practical rule: **functions that do the work should return data, not write to stdout.** The CLI entry point handles all I/O.

```
Entry point (CLI main)              Your logic (handlers)
─────────────────────               ─────────────────────
parse args                          (input) → structured result
detect format (json/plain/human)    no printing to stdout
call handler                        no writing to stderr
format the result                   no calling exit
write to correct stream             just returns data
set exit code
```

This isn't an architecture mandate — it's just clean function design. The benefits are concrete:

- **Testable without subprocess spawning** — call the handler, assert on the returned value
- **Format flexibility for free** — same data renders as JSON, plain text, or coloured tables by swapping one function
- **Reusable** — the same handler works from a CLI, MCP server, HTTP API, or programmatic import

For simple CLIs where the "handler" is just calling a library, this separation already exists naturally — your library returns data, your CLI formats it. No extra layers needed.

If your project uses hexagonal architecture, the mapping is direct: the CLI entry point is a **driving adapter**, and the handler is a **use case** that returns a result through a port. See the `hexagonal-architecture` skill — the patterns reinforce each other, but hex arch is not required to benefit from keeping handlers pure.

For TypeScript implementation patterns (Result types, entry point wiring, formatters, logger interfaces), see `resources/output-architecture.md`.

## Recommended TypeScript Stack

Chosen because each maps directly onto rules in this skill — pick by the rules, not popularity:

| Tool | Why it fits |
|------|-------------|
| [Stricli](https://bloomberg.github.io/stricli/) (command framework) | Commands are plain typed functions receiving an injected context — "Keep Handlers Pure" is the framework's native shape, so handlers test without subprocess spawning. No decorators or classes; strict flag/arg type inference; introspectable command tree (enables machine-readable self-description); minimal dependencies keep startup inside the 100ms responsiveness budget |
| [@clack/prompts](https://github.com/bombshell-dev/clack) (interactivity) | Prompts as an optional presentation adapter: gate on TTY + `--no-input`/`--json`/`CI`, so interactivity is additive and every prompt stays bypassable. Cancel handling built in; tiny footprint |

Alternatives and why not: **commander** is ubiquitous but stringly-typed — options arrive untyped, fighting strict mode. **oclif** is mature but class/decorator-based with heavy startup — wrong shape for pure handlers and hook-invoked CLIs. **@effect/cli** is schema-first with a free `--wizard` mode, but drags the entire Effect runtime and paradigm in — too much buy-in for a CLI layer that should stay thin.

---

## Format Flag Contract

Three-tier output hierarchy:

### Default: Human-Readable

- Colors, tables, formatted text
- Progress bars and spinners on **stderr**
- Output tailored for terminal width
- May change between versions — this is **not** a contract

### `--plain`: Grep/Awk-Friendly

- One record per line, no formatting, no colors
- Stable between minor versions — this **is** a contract
- Flat table rows, no borders, no grouped sections
- Enables: `mycli list --plain | grep error | wc -l`

> "Encourage your users to use `--plain` or `--json` in scripts to keep output stable." — clig.dev

### `--json`: Structured Data

- stdout contains **ONLY** valid JSON — no spinners, no color, no progress
- stderr continues normally — human diagnostics still visible
- Errors are structured JSON too — not just success responses
- Schema is versioned — breaking changes to JSON output are breaking changes to the CLI
- `--json` implies non-interactive regardless of TTY

**Consistent envelope:**

```json
{ "ok": true, "data": { ... } }
{ "ok": false, "error": { "code": "CONFIG_MISSING", "message": "...", "fix": "..." } }
```

### NDJSON for Streaming

For large datasets, use NDJSON (one JSON object per `\n`):

- Each line is independently parseable
- Include a `type` field per record for multiplexing events
- Final line can be a summary record
- Enables: `mycli run --format ndjson | while read -r line; do ...; done`

For NDJSON specification details, see `resources/stream-contracts.md`.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning | When |
|------|---------|------|
| 0 | Success | Operation completed as expected |
| 1 | Domain failure | Tool-specific failure (e.g. quality threshold not met) |
| 2 | Invalid usage | Bad flags, missing required args, validation error |
| 78 | Configuration error | Invalid config file, missing required config |
| 75 | Temporary failure | Network timeout, service unavailable — retry may help |
| 130 | SIGINT | User pressed Ctrl-C (128 + 2) |
| 143 | SIGTERM | Process terminated (128 + 15) |

**Rules:**

- Non-zero exit code **MUST** have a stderr explanation
- Document exit codes in `--help`
- Never use codes above 125 for application errors (reserved for signals: 128 + signal number)
- Exit code 75 (transient) is critical — it tells retry logic the failure may be temporary
- Map non-zero codes to the most important failure modes for your tool

---

## TTY Detection

Check priority order (first match wins):

| Priority | Condition | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `--format json` or `--json` flag | Non-interactive, no color, no animation |
| 2 | `--no-color` flag | Disable color (output may still be interactive) |
| 3 | `NO_COLOR` env (non-empty) | Disable color |
| 4 | `FORCE_COLOR` env | Enable color even when not a TTY (`NO_COLOR` still wins) |
| 5 | `TERM=dumb` | Disable color and animations |
| 6 | `CI=true` | No interactive prompts |
| 7 | stdout is not a TTY (`!isatty(stdout)`) | Plain output, no animations on stdout |
| 8 | Default | Full interactive with colors |

**Check stdout and stderr independently.** When stdout is piped but stderr is a TTY, you can still show spinners on stderr while keeping stdout clean for the pipe consumer.

Optionally support `MYCLI_NO_COLOR` for app-specific color override.

---

## Input Design

### Flags Over Arguments

- **1 positional arg**: acceptable (the "main thing")
- **2 positional args**: suspicious — consider flags instead
- **3+ positional args**: never acceptable
- **Exception**: variadic args of the same type are fine (`rm a.txt b.txt c.txt`), as are universal idioms (`cp source dest`)

Flags are self-documenting, order-independent, and future-proof.

```bash
# Bad — which is source, which is destination?
mycli copy myapp backup

# Good — explicit
mycli copy --from myapp --to backup
```

### Standard Flags

Always provide long forms. Short flags only for the most common operations.

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-h`, `--help` | Show help (this should only mean help) |
| `--version` | Print version to stdout |
| `-q`, `--quiet` | Suppress non-essential output |
| `-v`, `--verbose` | More detail in human output |
| `-d`, `--debug` | Diagnostic output to stderr |
| `-f`, `--force` | Skip confirmation prompts |
| `-n`, `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without doing it |
| `--json` | Structured JSON output |
| `--plain` | Stable, grep-friendly plain text |
| `--no-color` | Disable color output |
| `--no-input` | Disable all prompts/interactivity |
| `-o`, `--output` | Output file |
| `--fields` | Select output columns |

### Prompts and Interactivity

- **All prompts MUST be bypassable** via flags for scriptability
- Confirmation → `--yes` or `--force`
- Selection → `--type=value`
- Text input → `--name=value`
- Passwords → `--password-file=path` or stdin pipe
- If stdin is not a TTY, never prompt — fail with a clear error or use defaults
- **Secrets: never via flag values** (leak to `ps` output and shell history). Prefer, in order: OS keychain or a `0600` credential file (`~/.config/mycli/credentials`), then stdin (`mycli login --with-token < token.txt`), then env vars **only where the platform injects them** (CI secret stores) — env leaks to child processes and crash reports, so never make it the primary documented path
- **Scale confirmation to severity**: mild → `y/N` prompt with `--yes` bypass; moderate → prompt plus suggest `--dry-run` first; severe/irreversible (delete a database, overwrite production) → require typing the resource name to confirm

### Conventions

- Support `--` to stop flag parsing: `mycli run -- --flag-for-child-process`
- Support `-` for stdin/stdout file arguments: `curl ... | mycli process -`
- Accept both `--flag=value` and `--flag value`
- If stdin is expected but is an interactive terminal, display help immediately (don't hang like `cat`)

---

## Config Precedence

Highest to lowest priority:

1. **Flags** — per-invocation overrides
2. **Environment variables** — `MYCLI_*` prefix, per-session
3. **Project config** — `.myclirc`, `mycli.config.ts`, or in `package.json`
4. **User config** — `~/.config/mycli/` (follow XDG spec)
5. **Defaults** — sensible built-in values

**Rules:**

- Follow the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) for config file locations
- Env var naming: `MYCLI_*` prefix, uppercase letters + digits + underscores; keep values single-line; don't commandeer POSIX names
- Respect the general-purpose env vars where relevant: `NO_COLOR`, `FORCE_COLOR`, `DEBUG`, `EDITOR`, `PAGER`, `HTTP_PROXY`/`HTTPS_PROXY`/`NO_PROXY`, `TMPDIR`, `TERM`, `LINES`/`COLUMNS`
- Never accept secrets via flags; prefer keychain/credential files or stdin, env vars only when platform-injected (CI) — see "Prompts and Interactivity"
- Read `.env` where appropriate, but don't use it as a substitute for proper config
- If you modify configuration that belongs to another program, ask consent first

---

## Error Design

Every error needs:

1. **Machine-readable code** — `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g. `CONFIG_MISSING`, `AUTH_EXPIRED`)
2. **What went wrong** — context: which resource, operation, input
3. **How to fix it** — exact command or action the user should take
4. **Reference** — docs URL or `mycli help <topic>` (optional)

### Human Mode

```
Error: CONFIG_MISSING — Configuration file not found
No configuration file found at ./mycli.config.ts or ~/.config/mycli/config.ts

Fix: Run `mycli init` to create a default configuration file
Docs: https://mycli.dev/docs/configuration
```

- Put the most important information **last** (the eye is drawn to the end)
- Use red sparingly and intentionally
- Suggest corrections for typos ("Did you mean 'deploy'?")
- Group similar errors under one header — don't repeat 50 similar-looking lines
- Write debug logs to a file, not the terminal (unless `--debug`)

### JSON Mode

Errors are structured too — not just success responses:

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "CONFIG_MISSING",
    "message": "No configuration file found at ./mycli.config.ts",
    "fix": "Run `mycli init` to create a default configuration file",
    "transient": false
  }
}
```

The `transient` boolean tells retry logic whether the failure may be temporary.

---

## State Changes and Transparency

- **Confirm state changes** — say what changed and show (or point to) the resulting state; traditionally-silent commands look broken to humans
- **Make current state easy to see** — a `status`-style command for anything with complex state (the `git status` pattern)
- **Make hidden actions explicit** — if you read/write files not passed as arguments or talk to remote servers, say so (stderr in human mode)
- **Page long output** through `$PAGER` (e.g. `less -FIRX`) — only when stdout is a TTY, never when piped

---

## Robustness

- **Validate input early** — fail before any side effects, with a clear message
- **Responsiveness beats speed** — print something within 100ms; show progress on stderr for anything long-running, with time estimates when progress can stall
- **Timeouts on all network operations** — configurable, and exit 75 so retry logic knows the failure is transient
- **Recoverable by re-run** — after a transient failure, re-running the command should resume or be safely idempotent
- **Crash-only design** — exit fast on failure, defer cleanup to the next run; add timeouts to cleanup so Ctrl-C never hangs (second Ctrl-C skips cleanup) — see `resources/stream-contracts.md`
- **Expect misuse** — script wrapping, bad connections, concurrent instances, environments you never tested

---

## Composability Patterns

Design for real-world pipes: filtering with `jq`, streaming NDJSON line-by-line, feeding stdin, chaining commands through emitted identifiers, selecting columns with `--fields`, and fanning out with `xargs -P`.

See `resources/composability.md` for the worked shell examples covering each of these patterns.

**Key patterns:**

- Create commands output identifiers so subsequent commands can chain
- List commands support `--fields` for column selection (reduces output size, critical for agent efficiency)
- `--quiet` for CI scripts that only care about the exit code
- NDJSON for streaming large datasets without buffering everything in memory
- `--dry-run` with `--json` outputs planned changes as structured data

---

## Subcommand Design

- **noun verb** pattern is most common: `mycli config set`, `mycli report generate`
- Be consistent across all subcommands — same flag names for same things
- No ambiguous pairs (`update` vs `upgrade` is confusing)
- No catch-all subcommands (you can never add subcommands with conflicting names)
- No arbitrary abbreviations — aliases must be explicit and stable
- With no args: list subcommands (multi-command CLI) or show help (single-command CLI)

### Help

- `mycli --help` — top-level help
- `mycli help <subcommand>` — subcommand help
- `mycli <subcommand> --help` — same as above
- If run with missing required args, show concise help + 1-2 examples + "use --help for more"
- **Examples are the most-read section** — lead with them
- Include flag types, defaults, and allowed values for finite sets
- Include a support/bug-report link in top-level help; pre-populate issue URLs with diagnostics where possible
- Suggest the likely command on obvious typos ("Did you mean 'deploy'?") — ask, never auto-execute

---

## Output Stability Contract

**Stdout is a public API.** Breaking changes to stdout format are breaking changes to the CLI.

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Adding new optional JSON fields | Safe (additive) |
| Adding new subcommands | Safe |
| Adding new flags with preserving defaults | Safe |
| Removing or renaming flags | **Breaking** |
| Removing or renaming JSON fields | **Breaking** |
| Changing exit codes | **Breaking** |
| Changing default behavior | **Breaking** |
| Changing human-readable output | Usually OK (not a contract) |

When in doubt, add alongside — don't modify. Deprecate with stderr warnings before removing — and once you can detect that users have migrated, stop warning.

---

## Naming, Distribution, Telemetry

- **Name**: short, memorable, lowercase, easy to type; not so generic it collides with existing commands
- **Distribution**: prefer a single binary; language-ecosystem tools (npm, pip) may reasonably assume their interpreter. Make uninstalling easy and documented
- **Telemetry**: never collect usage/crash data without explicit consent — opt-in, stating what, why, and retention. Instrumented web docs or download counts are usually enough

---

## Anti-Patterns

| # | Anti-Pattern | Why It's Wrong |
|---|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | Mixing data and diagnostics on stdout | Breaks every pipe: `mycli list \| jq .` fails if warnings are on stdout |
| 2 | Colors/ANSI in piped output | ANSI sequences corrupt downstream parsing. Check `isatty(stdout)` + `NO_COLOR` |
| 3 | Interactive prompts with no flag bypass | Agents can't type 'y'. Every prompt needs `--yes`/`--force`. Non-TTY without bypass = hang |
| 4 | Printing nothing on success | Silence is ambiguous — show brief confirmation. Offer `-q` for scripts that want silence |
| 5 | Designing for humans OR machines, not both | Detect context (TTY vs pipe), adapt automatically |
| 6 | Output that doesn't guide the next action | Every output is a signpost: success = next command, failure = fix command |
| 7 | Breaking existing CLI contracts | Flag names, exit codes, output shape are contracts. Add alongside, never modify |
| 8 | `console.log` anywhere except the CLI adapter | Handlers must return data; only the presentation layer writes to streams |
| 9 | Handlers that exit the process directly | Let the entry point decide. Handlers return errors as data |
| 10 | Non-zero exit without stderr explanation | Scripts need both the code and the reason |
| 11 | Verbose default output | A single test run can generate 419KB. Support `--fields`, `--quiet`, `--json` |

---

## Quick Reference

Stream routing, exit codes, and standard flags are tabled in the body — see "The Unix Stream Contract", "Exit Codes", and "Standard Flags" above.

### Format Hierarchy

```
Default (TTY)     → colors, tables, formatted text
--plain           → one record per line, stable, grep-friendly
--json            → structured JSON, versioned schema
--format ndjson   → streaming, one JSON object per line
```

### Config Precedence

```
flags > env vars > project config > user config > defaults
```
