description: Produce a mock-audit storyboard — a single HTML page embedding every UX surface in a scope of work side-by-side, with per-mock audit checklists, a flow diagram, and gap cards for missing mocks. Use before any feature touching multiple UX surfaces begins implementation. Also use when the user says "make it easy for me to see all these mocks in one place", "audit the mocks", or "I want to review the whole flow".

# Storyboard

A **storyboard** is a single reviewable HTML page that stitches every UX surface in a scope of work into one view. Each existing mock is embedded as a live `<iframe>`. A flow diagram at the top shows how the user moves through them. Gap cards mark mocks that still need producing. Per-mock audit checklists give the reviewer a place to approve or flag concrete fixes.

**Purpose:** move the design audit from "open a dozen tabs and try to hold the flow in your head" to "open one page and scroll". Gives you a reviewable artifact that pairs with whatever textual decision record you keep (a plan doc, an audit note, a PR description).

## When to produce one

- **Before any feature whose scope touches ≥ 2 UX surfaces begins implementation.** Examples: a signup flow (signup → verify email → onboarding), a settings page (profile / notifications / delete / billing), an invitation flow (send → email → accept → landing).
- **Before a planned chunk of work that covers multiple surfaces** — whatever the project's unit of planning (milestone, epic, phase, batch). When the chunk collectively touches multiple surfaces, storyboard the whole thing before starting.
- **Single-feature audit** when a feature spans multiple states (a flow with loading / empty / populated / error states across 3+ steps).
- **The user explicitly asks** for "everything in one place", "the whole flow", "audit the mocks", "I want to see all of this together".
- **Before producing new mocks.** Storyboarding the existing ones first reveals gaps visually and forces brainstorm questions per gap before drafting.

## When NOT to produce one

- Single-mock work (a one-off copy fix on a settings page). Open the mock, run the impeccable pipeline, done.
- Purely API / data-migration / ops items with no UX surface. No mocks = nothing to storyboard.
- Exploratory / throwaway work before scope is settled. Storyboard is a reviewing artifact; you need something worth reviewing first.
- Features already fully built. The storyboard is pre-implementation. Post-hoc, if you need a visual review, run the `critique` skill (external, from the impeccable family; skip if not installed) on the live surfaces instead.

## Inputs the skill gathers

Before drafting the HTML, gather:

1. **Scope code + title.** E.g. `Onboarding v2 — reset regression`, `Settings page — profile + notifications`, `M3 · address book`. Sets the page title + breadcrumb.
2. **Existing mocks in scope.** Walk the project's design-mocks folder (or equivalent) and collect the paths relevant to this scope. Each existing mock becomes an embedded panel.
3. **User flow.** The sequence of states + transitions the user walks through. Draw as ASCII in a `<pre>` block. Mark gaps with distinctive colour / glyph.
4. **Gaps.** New mocks the scope needs but doesn't have yet. Each gap gets its own card with brainstorm questions the user must answer before we produce it — no gap without questions.
5. **Upstream / adjacent surfaces.** Not part of this scope but provide context (e.g. where the user lands after this flow). Embed at smaller iframe height.
6. **Links to companion docs.** Plan entry, design brief, relevant ADR, parent index page.

## Output location

Place the storyboard HTML in the project's existing mocks or launch-planning folder, next to where the mocks live so relative iframe paths work. Common locations:

- `apps/<app>/design-mocks/<scope>-audit.html`
- `design-mocks/<scope>-storyboard.html`

Never place storyboards inside `plans/` — plan files are deleted when their work completes (see the `planning` skill), and the storyboard should outlive the plan.

Match the naming convention of other artifacts in the repo. If there's a mock manifest or index page, add a featured link to the storyboard so it's discoverable.

## Required structure (sections in order)

A storyboard is a pattern, not a template. Every storyboard has these sections in this order; the content inside each is specific to the scope.

### 1. Breadcrumb

Back-link to the parent index (mocks manifest, planning index, etc.).

### 2. Header

- Small pill with scope code (e.g. `Onboarding v2` or whatever the project uses) in an uppercase-tracking style.
- Serif display title describing the scope.
- Short subhead (one sentence) naming the purpose of this page.
- Paragraph explaining what the scope is + link row to item README, design brief, and any relevant ADR.

### 3. Flow diagram

- **Use `<pre>` for ASCII, never `<div class="whitespace-pre">`.** Prettier reformats the latter and destroys the layout; `<pre>` is immune. This is a hard rule — violating it ships a broken page.
- ASCII boxes + arrows showing the user's journey through the scope.
- Colour-code inline: one colour for existing-mocked nodes, a distinct colour for gaps (preferably the project's "action" colour so the user's eye goes there), a muted colour for adjacent/context surfaces.
- Mark gaps with an inline glyph like `🆕 GAP` so they're scannable at speed.

### 4. Existing mocks (side-by-side)

- Heading with a status badge ("✓ ships with …").
- Responsive grid (typically 3-column on desktop, collapsing to single column on mobile). One cell per mock.
- Each cell contains:
  - Small badge + filename header.
  - Mock name (serif display).
  - Short description (1–2 sentences).
  - `<iframe>` at fixed height (780px works well for primary mocks, 640px for adjacent; adjust to project).
  - "Open in new tab ↗" link.
  - **Audit checklist card** — prompts for each impeccable discipline relevant to the mock: `/critique`, `/clarify`, `/audit`, `/polish`, `/adapt`, `/impeccable harden`, `/distill`. Plus any scope-specific questions ("discoverability of edit affordance?", "loading state mocked?").

### 5. Transition / state gaps

When something should be mocked but isn't obvious (e.g. a post-action toast, a success confirmation) flag it as an "? unclear" section with a bullet list of brainstorm questions. Better to surface ambiguity than let it slip.

### 6. Gaps to fill

- Heading with a "🆕 produce next" badge.
- Responsive grid. One cell per gap.
- Visually distinct background / border (use the project's "action" tint).
- Each cell:
  - Badge + filename for the mock to be produced.
  - Serif display name.
  - Description of what the mock represents.
  - **Brainstorm questions** — unordered list. Each bullet = one explicit decision that must be made before drafting the mock. Cover: entry point(s), shape (sheet / dialog / page), field list, edge/error states, integration with existing patterns, destructive-action semantics, cancel behaviour.

### 7. Upstream / adjacent (for context)

- Smaller iframes.
- 3-column grid.
- Label each as "not this scope, here for context".
- Used for surfaces the user jumps INTO from this scope (detail pages that populate later) or OUT OF (upstream flows).

### 8. Proposed sequence

Ordered list describing the steps from this storyboard to code-lands:

1. User reviews this page; approves existing mocks or flags concrete fixes.
2. Answer the brainstorm questions on each gap card.
3. Produce the gap mocks via `/impeccable craft` + run them through the design pipeline (`/shape` → `/critique` → `/layout` → `/clarify` → `/polish`, plus `/adapt` for responsive + `/impeccable harden` for edge states).
4. Apply any fixes to existing mocks the audit flagged.
5. Commit mocks + audit note (with commit approval, per the repo's workflow gate). Code starts.

### 9. Footer

Meta line: scope code · last-updated date · pair-read links.

## Style conventions

Use the project's existing design tokens — **do not invent new ones**. If the project has a Tailwind config with brand colours, typography, and shadow tokens, import/reuse those so the storyboard looks native. Specifically:

- **Colours:** primary action (for gap cards + existing-mock badges), text, background, "done/exists" confirmation, and "uncertain/?" states. Four-to-five tokens cover everything.
- **Fonts:** a serif for display (page title, section headings, mock names) and a sans for body. Every storyboard has the same typographic rhythm.
- **Badges:** sage for "exists", coral/primary for "gap", gold/amber for "uncertain" — or whatever the project's palette calls those.
- **Iframe frame:** fixed height, border, rounded corners, light shadow. Same visual weight across the grid.
- **Container:** `max-w-7xl mx-auto` for the outer width so the page has breathing room on ultra-wide monitors.

Match the local codebase's existing mock or index-page style. Copy the `<style>` block from a sibling mock rather than re-inventing.

## Prettier safety

Three rules learned the hard way:

1. **Always wrap ASCII / multi-line preformatted content in `<pre>`.** Prettier reformats HTML inside `<div class="whitespace-pre">` and destroys the layout. `<pre>` is immune.
2. **Don't fight markdown table column widths.** Write the table; let prettier realign it; commit the realigned version.
3. **Run `prettier --write` on the storyboard file before committing.** If the project has a prettier pre-commit hook it catches this anyway, but it's faster to format up-front.

## Convention integration

After producing the storyboard:

1. **Link it from the project's mocks manifest or index page** under an "Active audits" or similar section so it's discoverable.
2. **Reference it from the decision-record markdown** (the plan file, audit note, or PR description) as the visual companion.
3. **Reference it from the item / feature README(s)** in the "Design" section.
4. The storyboard supersedes scattered "here's the hub-list mock, click here for the archive confirm" links. One place, always.

## Non-negotiables

- **Live iframes, not screenshots.** The mocks must render — reviewers need to click, scroll, and see real behaviour. Screenshots go stale instantly; embedded iframes stay current.
- **Gaps must have brainstorm questions.** A gap card without questions is dead weight. Each gap is a forcing function to make decisions before drafting.
- **One page, not a tree.** Scrolling through one page is cheaper than navigating a tree of links. If the scope is so big the page becomes unreadable, split by sub-flow but keep each split to one page.
- **Checklist is genuine, not decorative.** Every item on the audit checklist corresponds to a real design discipline. The reviewer uses the checklist to guide review; the agent uses it to guide follow-up work. Don't list `/critique` if `/critique` won't actually run.

## Anti-patterns

❌ **Using `<img>` screenshots of the mocks.**
Screenshots go stale the moment the underlying mock changes. Iframes stay current. Every storyboard uses `<iframe>` for embedded mocks.

❌ **"TODO: add brainstorm questions" on a gap card.**
A gap without answered questions is a gap without the skill's value. Brainstorm now or remove the card.

❌ **Inventing bespoke design tokens for the storyboard.**
The storyboard should feel native to the project. Use the same Tailwind colours / fonts / shadows as the underlying mocks.

❌ **Navigation tree instead of one scrollable page.**
The storyboard's value is "everything in one place". A tree of sub-pages defeats that. Split only when the single page becomes unreadably long, and document the split reason.

❌ **`<div class="whitespace-pre">` for ASCII diagrams.**
Prettier reformats inner HTML and destroys the diagram. Use `<pre>` every time.

❌ **Producing new mocks before the storyboard is reviewed.**
The storyboard's brainstorm questions drive decisions. Drafting mocks first pre-commits to answers that may be wrong.

## Invocation

User says `/storyboard <scope>` or asks one of the trigger phrases (see frontmatter description). The skill:

1. Reads the relevant item/feature docs + any existing mock manifest entry.
2. Gathers existing mocks, flow, gaps, adjacent surfaces.
3. Drafts brainstorm questions for each gap (doesn't answer them — the user will).
4. Produces the HTML file at the canonical project path.
5. Updates the mocks manifest / index page with the featured link.
6. Reports back with the file path + brief summary so the user can open it in a browser.

## Related skills

- **`impeccable`** family (`/shape`, `/critique`, `/layout`, `/clarify`, `/audit`, `/polish`, `/adapt`, `/impeccable harden`, `/distill`) — external skills from pbakaus/impeccable; the audit checklists reference these and the gap-mock production step runs them. Note `harden` exists only as an `/impeccable` subcommand, not a standalone skill. If they aren't installed, list only the disciplines that will actually run (see Non-negotiables: the checklist is genuine, not decorative).
- **`story-splitting`** — use when the storyboard reveals the feature is too broad or needs to be split by flow, role, state, interface, data, rule, or quality level before implementation.
- **`planning`** — plans live at project root; the storyboard artifact supplements the plan's decision record after the scope has been split into implementable slices.
- **`find-gaps`** — use after the storyboard exists to turn missing states, unanswered brainstorm questions, and unclear transitions into concrete acceptance criteria or mock-state specs.
- **`expectations`** — after the storyboard audit surfaces learnings worth preserving, capture them into CLAUDE.md / ADRs.

**Rules of thumb:**

- Live iframes always. No screenshots.
- Every gap has brainstorm questions.
- One page, not a tree.
- `<pre>` for ASCII. Never `<div class="whitespace-pre">`.
- Use the project's existing design tokens.
