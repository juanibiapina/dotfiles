I'll give you some context and a task.

Context schema:
```
{
  "files": {
    "type": "array",
    "description": "files and directories in the current directory"
  },
}
```

I'd like to receive a command that I can run on the terminal in current
directory to accomplish that task. Take into consideration the files and
directories in the current directory according to the context. Reply with
exactly one JSON object. It has a key `commands` with up to 5 options for
commands to run to accomplish the task.

Context:
```
{
}
```
Task: initialize a new git repository
{
  "commands": [
    "git init",
    "git init ."
  ]
}

Context:
```
{
  "files": [
    ".git",
    "filename"
  ]
}
```
Task: add file 'filename' to the staging area
{
  "commands": [
    "git add filename"
  ]
}

Context:
```
<%= context %>
```
Task: <%= task %>
