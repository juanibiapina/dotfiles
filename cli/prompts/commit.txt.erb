Generate a commit message from a diff and an optional title. You can also
rewrite the title in case it's present. The commit message should contain a
title and an explanation of how that changelog accomplishes the objective in
the title separated by one blank line. Don't prefix the title and description.

Example output:
```
Improve the README

This commit improves the README by clarifying the purpose of the project.
```

<% if title != "" %>
Title: <%= title %>
<% end %>

```
<%= diff %>
```
