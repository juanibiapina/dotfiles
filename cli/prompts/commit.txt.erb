Generate a commit description from a diff and perhaps a title. You can also rewrite the title in case it's present. The commit message should contain a title and an explanation of how that changelog accomplishes the objective in the title.

<% if title != "" %>
Title: <%= title %>
<% end %>

```
<%= diff %>
```
